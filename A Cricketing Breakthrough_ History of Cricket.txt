History of Cricket in the 20th Century


Within a brief period of time after its introduction, the history of cricket began to gain popularity among Indians. In the history of Indian cricket, the middle and latter half of the 19th Century was significant since they saw the game expand into practically all regions of the country.


After defeating the Australians in 2001, India’s skipper, Saurav Ganguly, led his team on a winning streak that included victories in Test matches against Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, the West Indies, and England. India’s highest ODI run-chase at Lord’s, 325 runs, was in the Natwest ODI Series final versus England during the England series. India and Sri Lanka shared the I.C.C. Champions Trophy that year. They then traveled to South Africa for the 2003 Cricket World Cup, where they made it to the final but lost to Australia.


Following the series, Greg Chappell replaced John Wright as the head coach of the Indian cricket team, whose coaching strategies proved to be divisive at first. 


As a result of the rift between Chappell and Ganguly, Rahul Dravid was appointed captain as a result of the tension. The team’s fortunes turned around once players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan, and Yuvraj Singh came into their own.
